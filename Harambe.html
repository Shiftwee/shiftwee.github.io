	<p> Harambe was one of our greatest soldiers on Earth. He is considered to be the reincarnation of Jesus Christ
	born and raised in southern georgia, he tried to protect an innocent child from the harm of a bullet, but the bullet took his life away. He only lived 17 years, and although many say that his death was justified, 
	it was not worth the life of a boy who lived less than 20% of his life.
